					<p>A team founded by 3 Call of Duty players 11 years ago,

					another mark on the esports scene.<br><br>

					Those three players were Eric “CLipZ” Rivera, Jeff “House
					Cat” Emann and Ben “Resistance” Christensen.<br><br>

					their most popular series was ILLCAMS.<br><br>

					In 2012, they reached one million subscribers on YouTube and
					began to appear in esports. They first appeared in Call of
					Duty and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournaments.<br><br>

					Columbus Open 2014, UMG Dallas 2015, Gfinity Summer
					Championship 2015 and MLG Pro League 2015 Season 3
					tournaments and defeated them in the final.<br><br>

					Their total earnings from these four tournaments was
					$120,000.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>

					Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, defeating their rivals

					final.<br><br>

					In the final of ESL One: New York 2017, they defeated Team
					Liquid 3-0 easily.<br><br>

					In the ELEAGUE CS:GO Premier 2017, they again defeated
					Astralis 2-0 in the grand final and won the championship.<br><br>

					They defeated mousesports in the Esports Championship Series
					Season 4 final and NAVI in the EPICENTER 2018 final. The
					team has lots of S-Tier titles and is considered one of the
					most successful teams in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
					history.</p>

					Championship Series with Mongraal in C2 S4 and K1nG in C2
					S6.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Call of Duty: World War II</h3>

					in the Call of Duty franchise, defeated OpTic Gaming in the
					CWL Pro League 2018 Stage 1 final in Call of Duty: World War
					II and reached the $200,000 championship prize.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</h3>
